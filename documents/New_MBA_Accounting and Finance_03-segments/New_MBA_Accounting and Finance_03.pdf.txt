INTRODUCTION

Depreciation accounting is mainly based on the concept of income. The matching of revenues and expenses is the idea of income. Frequently, the goods purchased are matched either immediately or within a year. The essence of the income notion is that expenses must be matched against earnings. The ultimate goal of matching is to figure out how much profit or loss the transaction will generate. If the assets are all long-term assets acquired by the company, they should be matched to the revenues generated by the company. The fundamental objective of the firm is to match the expenditure of the assets incurred by the firm at the time of purchase against the revenues. To have an effective matching against the revenues on every year, the amount of purchase has to be stretched. The stretching of expenses into many years is known as depreciation.

Depreciation, according to Dickens, is the permanent and ongoing reduction in the asset’s quality, quantity, and value. Depreciation is the term used to describe the gradual loss in the value of fixed assets. It is a match between the fixed charge expense and the revenue for the current year. The unrecovered component of the remaining/left should be carried forward to future years to match against the relevant revenues. The ultimate goal of depreciation is to replace fixed assets only when they are no longer useful using current revenues.

3.2 CONCEPT OF DEPRECIATION

Depreciation is an accounting concept that allows a corporation to write off the value of an asset over time, typically the asset’s useful life. Machinery and equipment, for example, are costly assets. Rather than recognizing the entire cost of an asset in the first year, depreciation allows businesses to spread out that cost and create revenue.

Depreciation is a method of accounting for changes in the carrying value of a property over time. The gap between the original cost and the cumulative depreciation over the years is known as carrying value.

Each corporation may decide when to start depreciating a fixed asset, also known as property, plant, and equipment. A small business, for example, might set a $500 threshold for depreciating an asset. A larger corporation, on the other hand, may set a $10,000 threshold below which all purchases are expensed immediately.

3.2.1 Need for Calculating Depreciation

Depreciation needs to be provided because an asset is bound to undergo wear and tear over a period of time. This reduces the asset’s working capacity and efficacy. As a result, this should represent the asset’s value as recorded in the books of accounts. Furthermore, when new technologies and innovation take hold, every asset becomes obsolete over time. As a result, the asset’s value will depreciate over time, and this must be factored in. In addition, depreciation is appropriate for complying with the accounting principle of matching. According to the matching principle, a period’s spending must be recognised at the same time as the period’s revenue. So, an asset which generates income must be depreciated as per given provisions.

3.2.2

Factors Affecting Depreciation

The amount of depreciation is impacted by a number of factors. Let us take a look at some of them. There are four main factors to consider when calculating the depreciation expense are as follows:

 The cost of the asset.

 The estimated salvage value of the asset. Salvage value (also called residual value) is the amount of money that the company expects to recover, less the disposal costs, on the date the asset is scrapped, sold, or traded in.

 Estimated useful life of the asset. Useful life refers to the window of time that a company plans to use

an asset. Useful life can be expressed in years, months, working hours, or units produced.

 Obsolescence should be considered when determining an asset’s useful life and will affect the calculation of depreciation. For example, a machine capable of producing units for 20 years may be obsolete in six years; therefore, the asset’s useful life is six years in this case.

For its business activities, a corporation is free to select the most appropriate depreciation method. According to accounting theory, organisations should select a depreciation method that accurately matches their economic situation. As a result, businesses can select a strategy for allocating asset costs to accounting periods based on the benefits derived from the asset’s use.

For financial reporting, most corporations utilise the straight-line technique, but they may use different methods for different assets. Use a depreciation method that assigns asset cost to accounting periods in a systematic and sensible manner is the most crucial criteria to follow.

3.3 METHODS OF CALCULATING DEPRECIATION

There are various methods of allocating depreciation over the useful life of assets. The method of providing depreciation is selected on the basis of various factors such as types of assets, nature of business, circumstances prevailing in business, etc. These methods are given below:

Straight Line Method

This method is also known as fixed installment method. In this method, depreciation is ascertained on the original cost by a fixed percentage, keeping in mind the scrap value of the assets. Under this method, the amount of depreciation remains uniform/fixed and the value of the asset becomes zero at the end of its life. It may also be calculated by the following formula:

Depreciation = Original Cost – (Scrape Value / Life of Assets in Year)

Diminishing Balance Method

The written-down-value method is another name for this method. Depreciation is computed on a decreasing value in this method, but the rate of depreciation remains constant. Every year, the amount of depreciation on assets lowers, but the asset’s value does not decline to zero. The cost of assets, scrap value, and useful life of the assets can all be used to calculate the rate of depreciation. The formula to compute the rate of depreciation is given below:  Rate 

Where, N stands for number of years of useful life of the asset, S for scrap value, C for cost of asset, and R for rate of depreciation.

Annuity Method

Depreciation on assets is computed using this approach, which takes into consideration the asset’s cost as well as interest. The annuity method is a compounded interest method that calculates depreciation based on the premise that depreciation plus the normal cost of capital to finance the assets will remain constant over the asset’s life. When calculating the amount of depreciation, this approach takes into account interest as well as the cost of the assets. Every year, the amount of interest is debited from the assets account, and the amount of depreciation is credited. The opening balance of the asset is used to calculate interest. So, it (interest) decreases every year but the amount of depreciation remains constant which is taken from the annuity tables for depreciation. This amount of depreciation is that much by which the value of asset becomes zero.

Depreciation Fund Method or Sinking Fund Method

This method is set up in such a way that the collected funds are immediately available to replace assets when their useful lives expire. The amount of depreciation on assets is put into a sinking fund using this procedure. Each year, an equivalent amount of depreciation is invested in government or marketable securities, and the interest earned on these securities is likewise reinvested. When the asset’s economic life expires, the securities are sold in the market, and the proceeds are used to replace the old assets. If any profit or loss is realised from the sale of these securities, it is credited to the profit and loss account.

Insurance Policy Method

The concept is related to that of a sinking fund. The firm takes out an insurance policy to replace the assets in this approach. The amount of premium is determined by the annual amount of depreciation, whereas the sinking fund technique requires the firm to purchase some securities. The sum of the premium, plus interest, is held by the insurance company. The insurance coverage matures when the assets’ useful life expires. The sum is made available by the insurance company upon maturity and is used to purchase new assets. As a result, the funds are safer and more liquid with this strategy.

Revaluation or Appraisal Method

As its name indicates, depreciation is calculated on the basis of revaluation of assets. After some time or an interval of a year, the assets are revalued by experts. The difference of the valuation of the two periods is called depreciation or appreciation of that period. Generally, this method is used in the case of livestock, copyrights and patents.

Depletion Method

It is also known as production method. This method is useful for natural assets such as coal mines, oil wells, etc. These are taken for excavation for a definite period on the contact basis. In this case, the depreciation is computed on the basis of production. First, the total production of the contract period is estimated, then total depreciable cost is divided by the total production and multiplied by annual output to determine the annual amount of depreciation. In the form of formula:

Annual Depreciation 

Annual Output

Total Estimated Output

30

Machine Hour Rate Method

When depreciation is calculated on the basis of working hours of the machine or plant, this method is used. The original cost of plant or machinery is divided by the total number of working hours of the machine or plant to find the machine hour rate. To compute the depreciation of a year the machine hour rate is multiplied by the total working hours of the machine/plant in a year. This procedure may be explained with the following formula:

Machine Hour Rate 

Original Cost of Machine Total Working Hours of the Machine Duringits Life

Annual Depreciation = Machine Hour Rate × Working Hours in a Year

3.4 ACCOUNTING TREATMENT OF DEPRECIATION

According to the concept of depreciation, the value of the asset is dispersed throughout the life of the period in order to match the respective earnings of the year after year. The purchase value of the asset is an expenditure to be stretched to many numbers of years in order to equate with the revenues. To equate the revenues, the scrap value of the asset at the end of the life period is realized should be deducted and apportioned to the total number of the economic life period of the asset. The aim of deducting the scrap value of the asset is reducing the original value of the investment.

Example: Cost of Machine - `1,00,000

Estimated life of the machine - 5 years

Scrap value - Nil

Depreciation = (Cost of the machine – Scrap value) / Economic Life period of the asset in years

Depreciation = (1,00,000 – 0) / 5

= ` 20,000

To understand the above calculation, the following table is important:

Value of the asset (Begin in `) Col. 1

Depreciation ( in `) Col. 2

Value of the asset (End) (in `) Col 3 = Col.1 – Col.2

1st year – 1,00,000

2nd year – 80,000

4th year – 40,000

“0”

From the above table, `20,000 is charged on every year to recover `1,00,000 during its life period i.e., 5 years.

Example 2: Original value of the investment – `1,00,000 Scrap value – `10,000

Life of the asset – 5 years

Depreciation = (1,00,000 – 10,000)/5

= `18,000
