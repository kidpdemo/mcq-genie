Mr. K. Rahman Khan, member of the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India (ICAI) and Honorary Deputy Chairman of the Rajya Sabha, stated.

Mr. Khan stated that the accounting system in local bodies has already been converted to double entry, and that the institute should play an important role in monitoring government expenditure.

“The responsibilities of a chartered accountant should not be limited to his clients alone. It is something he owes to society. The institute, as well as the Comptroller and Auditor General of India, the custodian of government expenditure, have already decided to carry out the conversion. Various Notes The double entry accounting system is now used by governments all around the world. He went on to say, “We need to transition to double entry as soon as possible.”

He corrected his statement by noting, “I am not implying that the government’s accounts are flawed.” We must ensure that there is more transparency. The double entry accounting system would allow us to track cost increases, look into the specifics of total government spending, and so on.”

Mr. G. Ramasamy, the ICAI’s Vice-President, stated that the government’s outlay for the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act Scheme totalled over 42,000 crores, and that over 6 lakh panchayats across the country were completing their spending statements. He stated, “The institute is assisting the panchayats in preparing the statement.”

He stated that all permissions for the implementation of the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) would be in place by July 31. The institute has begun programmes to educate professionals and restart the process in India, as well as launching an IFRS certification course. “We started with Nifty firms with a turnover of over 1,000 crores in the first phase.

According to him, the institute has signed memorandums of understanding with a number of overseas peers in order to strengthen bilateral ties. “We recently met with professional groups in West Asia to discuss the importance of strengthening networking relationships between members and professionals from both nations. He said, “Among others, we are looking to get into mutual recognition agreements with professional associations in Canada, Singapore, and New Zealand.”
