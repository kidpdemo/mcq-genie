Accounting is a business language which elucidates the various kinds of transactions during a given period of time. Accounting is broadly classified into three different functions:

1. Recording

2. Classifying

3. Summarising

The American Institute of Certified Public Accountants defines accounting as “the process of documenting, classifying, summarising in a meaningful manner financial transaction and eventually interpreting the outcomes.”

A well-known author of accounting, [Prof. R.R. Gupta, Principal, Poddar College, Nawalgarh (Rajasthan)] wrote in First write/record before one deliver goods or renders the services and if there is any disagreement in future, use the writing or record as an evidence to resolve the misunderstanding or rectifying the error.

Business transactions must be recorded for the benefit of the owners and other interested parties. The second group of people includes those who provide resources, products, and services to businesses, governments, and society at large. The creditors (suppliers who are ready to wait for payment) want to know if the firm will be able to pay them later (solvency of the business), whereas the government wants to know if the business has paid all taxes, fees, and other obligations.
