The "Applying" level of Bloom's taxonomy focuses on using knowledge to address new problems or concrete situations that typically have a single or optimal solution. This involves applying learned material such as rules, methods, concepts, principles, laws, and theories to demonstrate a deeper understanding of how to use this information effectively. Key behaviors associated with this level include actions like applying, demonstrating, solving, and employing, among others. Educational activities that support this level of understanding include engaging in case studies, solving text problems, and participating in scenarios that require the application of learned concepts in multiple contexts. Assessments might involve problem sets, demonstrations, or presentations that require students to apply, use, or solve problems based on their knowledge. An example of such an assessment could be applying theoretical knowledge to predict outcomes in practical situations, such as predicting visual perceptions under various conditions of color blindness using the Opponent Processes color theory.
