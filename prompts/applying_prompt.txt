Based on the application of concepts outlined in '{text_segment}', formulate {number_of_questions} multiple-choice question(s) where the student must apply these concepts to a new situation.
Include a scenario in the question and offer one correct solution among three distractors.
The question(s) should be clear, precise, and suitable for a {audience} audience.
Provide the correct option and a justification after the question and its options.
Ensure the question and options vary with each request to cover different aspects of the concept.

The question should be generated based on the following parameters:
Parameters:
    Bloom's Taxonomy Level: {btl}, where Bloom's Taxonomy level corresponds to the desired cognitive level, defined as: The "Application" level of Bloom's Taxonomy focuses on using knowledge to address new problems or concrete situations that typically have a single or optimal solution. This involves applying learned material such as rules, methods, concepts, principles, laws, and theories to demonstrate a deeper understanding of how to use this information effectively. Key behaviors associated with this level include actions like applying, demonstrating, solving, and employing, among others. Educational activities that support this level of understanding include engaging in case studies, solving text problems, and participating in scenarios that require the application of learned concepts in multiple contexts. Assessments might involve problem sets, demonstrations, or presentations that require students to apply, use, or solve problems based on their knowledge. An example of such an assessment could be applying theoretical knowledge to predict outcomes in practical situations, such as predicting visual perceptions under various conditions of color blindness using the Opponent Processes color theory.
    Difficulty Level: {difficulty_level}, where 'hard' is harder than 'medium', 'medium' is harder than 'easy'
    Target Audience: {audience}

Each question must be packaged as a json and json only.
The keys for a question being generated must be:
"question": the value is the text for the generated question,
"options": the value is a list of options with one correct and others as distractors,
"correct answer index": the value is a list of indexes corresponding to the correct answer(s) in the 'options',
"justification": the value is a list of justifications for each of the correct option(s)
