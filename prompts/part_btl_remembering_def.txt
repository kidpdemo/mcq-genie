The "Remembering" level of Bloom's taxonomy focuses on the rote factual understanding of specific terms, methodologies, conventions, and universally accepted principles within a field. This foundational level aims at enabling students to recall this learned information accurately when required, representing the most basic cognitive learning outcome. Key assessment phrases include "define," "list," "recall," and "identify," among others. Teaching methods that support this level of learning typically involve lectures, memorization, readings, and multimedia content such as podcasts and videos. Assessments are designed to test factual recall and are generally convergent with limited answers, such as multiple-choice exams or labeling diagrams, like identifying the parts of the human eye.
